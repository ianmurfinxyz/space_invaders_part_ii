# Space Invaders Part II ... Tribute :space_invader: :guitar:

Just a tribute to the best classic arcade :floppy_disk: :joystick: game in the world. One I wanted to make since I first started 
programming.

## Rendering

This is clone of the 1979 game space invaders part II implemented in C++ with a single file custom 
engine using SDL2 and Opengl 2.1. SDL2 is used for window management and to create the Opengl context 
whereas Opengl is used for all rendering.

The engine uses a somewhat novel approach to rendering (because I thought it would be fun, even
if not fast on modern hardware) in that all fonts and sprites are rendered as pure bitmap data using 
glBitmap and color is added by simply setting the draw color in the context. As a consequence 
all sprite assets and font glyphs are just arrays of 1s and 0s saved to files. 

To handle multiple screen resolutions the entire game world is scaled during initialisation
and all bitmaps are scaled to fit the world.

## Compilation and Dependencies

I have only tested this game on linux so it may not work on windows. The only libraries required 
to compile however are SDL2 and an Opengl implementation. On arch linux these can simply be
installed with,

```shell
$ pacman -S sdl2 mesa
```

then you can compile by running make,

```shell
$ make
```
