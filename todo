- improve logging - remove the std::cout logs at start of spaceinvaders.cpp
- add a morphing sound - currently using a copy of the invaderkill sound
- add more formations and levels
- [DONE] add a game over state, a sos state, and a state to enter name into score table
- [DONE] add mothership collisions 
- [DONE] handle collisions between alien and player missiles
- when the last alien gets to the bottom of the screen the game switches to another state
  where an alien spawns at the top of the screen, dropping decoys, moving quickly from left to
  right, do I want to implement this?
- [SKIP FOR NOW]implement the schrodinger reinforcements
- [SKIP] investigate and fix why the game isnt scaling when I resize the window. - If I remember correctly
  I think it is because I can scale down the bunkers because I mask off arbitrary chunks of pixels
  thus a damaged bunker cannot be scaled down without loosing information, meaning I could not
  scale it back up again afterwards unless I created information. Yes I could store the larger
  copy and create a seperate smaller one, but what if my original bunker is actually the smaller
  one. Then I have no choice but to create information from nowhere.
- [DONE] fix the 'y' on the splash screen
- [SKIP] make it possible to skip the splash screen
- add a cheat mode which can be activated via a cli arg or via a .cfg file
- [DONE] implement the music beats
- draw one of the cabinet arts for the background? see here,
    http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/graphics
  artwork 2 looks most appropriate
- [DONE] a sign that pops up detailing the round number when aliens are spawning?
- [DONE] draw the cannons on the hud to show num lives - was drawing with old hud system that I
  stripped but not the new one. (is it even possible with the current setup of the new one?)
- add the option to play the space invaders song instead of the beats? (or both?)
- [DONE] jthe high score system

[26-03-2021]
- [DONE] added the beatbox but it needs to pause when the cannon booms, and during alien spawning etc,
  also need to decide how to vary beat with game state.
- [DONE] currently freeze the player and aliens when an alien dies to mimic the origin game, however
  do not freeze bombs thus can die when frozen...bad game design, either freeze the bombs or rm
  the freezes. I should freeze the aliens but not the player, easy solution.
- there are a few gameplay aspects I was unaware of that I would like to add, see here,
    https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9669

"
CHEATS, TRICKS, BUGS, AND EASTER EGGS
On any wave, if the last alien you kill is from the bottom two rows, you will be rewarded with 
a special 'fireworks' display and a 500 point bonus. If the bottom leftmost invader is the last 
killed, the bonus is 1,000 points.

[DONE] The number of points you get for shooting the solid flying saucer (50 - 300) depends upon how 
many shots you have fired in the wave. The 23rd shot and every 15th thereafter is worth 300 
points if it hits the saucer. When there are eight or fewer invaders left, the flying saucers 
no longer appear.

- the game has some way of gaining lives, which I saw in this video,
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY_8zv7iXEg
  should find out what triggers the extra life and add the feature.
- according to this video the last alien alive actually moves 2px per tick when moving left and
  3px per tick when moving right. This is to make it harder to calibrate your aiming since the
  speed keeps changing. I like that idea and should add it. 
       this vid --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpI2i1XIBdI
- [SKIP] also when you die all aliens flash red. not sure my implementation is setup to make such a 
  thing easy though so may not add that - look into it.
- [DONE] should consider if I want a text box to enter the high scorer name or a letter grid, a grid
  would be more authentic to the original but kinda pointless since I am making a PC game and
  you could just use the keyboard. I think the text grid would be more fun to implement though
  so lets do that.
- according to this site,
https://spaceinvaders.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Invaders_Part_II
  the crab invaders only start splitting into cuttles after lvl 3.

[29-03-2021]
- [DONE] need to implement the test for aliens reaching screen bottom.
- appears to be a bug where the aliens vere of the screen and a seg fault happens, not sure
  why, it happened whilst the cannon was in respawn mode. Does the cannon respaning effect how
  the aliens are processed in any way?

- the bombs do varying damage and move at varying speeds:
    - straight are slow
    - cross are fast
    - wiggly are powerful (more damage to shelters)
- [DONE] bombs have a chance to survive collisions with lasers, wiggly powerful bombs very high chance
- [DONE] on screen 1 invaders need to drop 11 times to reach invasion row and win the game, from screen 
  2 to 9 they get lower down the screen, at screen 10 they start with 11 drops again and the
  cycle repeats.
- [DONE] bombs do not harm the player on the row above invasion row.
- [DONE] the mystery ship is actually worth varying points: 50, 100, 150, 300. 300 if shot on the
  23 laser fired, or every 15 after, so the pattern to max score is,
      22 shots, 23rd hit ufo, 14 shots, 15th hit ufo, 14 shots, 15th hit ufo etc
  it doesn't matter if your shots hit or miss, only the count matters.
- [DONE] mothership spawn randomly approx every 25seconds
- add a stats mode that runs after game over and before the high score mode which shows you
  stats on how many aliens killed, how many motherships hit, lasers fired, hit rate etc.
- [DONE] - did the messages - add an invasion state or animation or something
- setup formation and levels and how the game is to repeat.
- do varying bomb damage to the shelters.
- [DONE] make the schrodinger phase in and out
- [SKIP] make the score flash when the round starts.
- [SKIP] add some sound effects to the menu when you click options 
- [SKIP] play the invader song during splash and menu?
- [DONE] check on how when I am making the aliens fire and perhaps make it better if needed. Chance to fire?
- [DONE] add sounds when alien are spawn dropping
- [DONE] dont start beat box until aliens have stopped spawning
- [DONE] cleanup when game over and invasion.

- features added readme:
  want a full feature and gameplay list which details the exact specs of how the game plays in 
  the readme.

    - bomb move at different speeds and have different chances to be destroyed. list the speeds 
      and chances.
    - ufos have different score values - random set and a special set when you do...
      etc.

[01-04-2021]
- strip the cheats out of the game loop
